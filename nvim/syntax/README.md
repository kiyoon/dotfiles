# Crippling syntax highlighting

Most of the files here are NOT to improve syntax highlighting, but to cripple it.

## Why?

To prefer semantic highlighting over syntax highlighting. It will make colours when you write semantically correct code. And existing syntax highlighting distracts from that.

## Why not change treesitter highlighting?

Treesitter highlighting can be changed to be minimised, but sometimes we need them apart from editing code (like markdown code blocks).

## Affected filetypes

- python (with a plugin)
- javascript
- javascriptreact
- typescript
- typescriptreact
